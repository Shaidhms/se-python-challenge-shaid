## üîß Setup
. What's up, baby, ma?
1.	Clone the repo
  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repo>.git
cd <your-repo>/day13
```

2.	Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
# .\venv\Scripts\activate for Windows
```

	3.	Install dependencies


pip install -r requirements.txt
# or
pip install streamlit requests


	4.	Add your logo
	‚Ä¢	Put a file named se.png in the same folder as app.py.
	‚Ä¢	You can replace it with any PNG. The app reads it as a base64 string.
	5.	Run

streamlit run app.py



‚∏ª

üéÆ How to Play
	‚Ä¢	Enter your Player name at the top.
	‚Ä¢	Choose Match format: Best of 3 or Best of 5.
	‚Ä¢	Click ROCK, PAPER, or SCISSORS.
	‚Ä¢	The app plays the GIFs, then reveals the round result and updates the scoreboard.
	‚Ä¢	After the last round, the app announces the match winner and disables move buttons.
	‚Ä¢	Use START NEW MATCH to play again.
	‚Ä¢	Use RESET SCORES to clear the board and start fresh in the same format.

‚∏ª

üñºÔ∏è GIF Configuration

The app uses a small dictionary called GIF_URLS inside app.py:

GIF_URLS = {
    "player_rock": "https://‚Ä¶/giphy.gif",
    "player_paper": "https://‚Ä¶/giphy.gif",
    "player_scissors": "https://‚Ä¶/giphy.gif",
    "cpu_rock": "https://‚Ä¶/giphy.gif",
    "cpu_paper": "https://‚Ä¶/giphy.gif",
    "cpu_scissors": "https://‚Ä¶/giphy.gif",
}

	‚Ä¢	Replace these with your own URLs if you want different animations.
	‚Ä¢	The app fetches the GIF with a browser-like header and falls back to loading by URL if needed.

‚∏ª

üèÜ Match Logic
	‚Ä¢	Each click triggers CPU selection and ‚Äústages‚Äù the result.
	‚Ä¢	The app waits briefly so the GIFs can play, then reveals the outcome.
	‚Ä¢	Scores are updated after the animation.
	‚Ä¢	Rounds increment automatically.
	‚Ä¢	At the end of 3 or 5 rounds, the app announces:
	‚Ä¢	{Player} WINS, or
	‚Ä¢	CPU WINS, or
	‚Ä¢	DRAW if scores are tied

‚∏ª

üìä Scoreboard and History
	‚Ä¢	Scoreboard shows ROUND: X / N, Player score, Draws, and CPU score.
	‚Ä¢	Move History dropdown lists each round with the moves, result, and timestamp:

Round 3 ‚Äî Paper vs Rock ‚Üí WIN (12:45:08)



‚∏ª

üß™ Developer Tools

Open the sidebar and enable Testing Mode:
	‚Ä¢	Set a random seed to make CPU choices reproducible during testing.

‚∏ª

üöÄ Deploy

Streamlit Community Cloud
	1.	Push this project to GitHub.
	2.	Create a new app on Streamlit Community Cloud.
	3.	Point it to day13/app.py.

‚∏ª

‚ùó Troubleshooting
	‚Ä¢	GIFs feel slow
Large or remote GIFs can take time to load. Try smaller files or different hosts.
	‚Ä¢	No logo
Ensure se.png is present and readable. You can also comment out the logo block.
	‚Ä¢	Buttons disabled
After the last round in the chosen format, the match ends and buttons are disabled. Click START NEW MATCH.
