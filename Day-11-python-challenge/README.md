## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

All key configurations are located at the top of the `app.py` file. You can easily customize:

  - **Colors:** Adjust the `PRIMARY_COLOR`, `SECONDARY_COLOR`, etc.
  - **Store details:** Change `STORE_NAME`, `STORE_ADDRESS`, `TAX_RATE`, and `CURRENCY_SYMBOL`.
  - **Menu items and offers:** The `MENU` and `OFFERS` lists can be modified to add, remove, or change items and promotions.

## üßæ Invoice & Exports

  - **PDF Invoice:** The app generates PDFs using ReportLab. To ensure proper display, it uses `Rs` instead of the `‚Çπ` symbol, which can sometimes have rendering issues with standard fonts like Helvetica. If you need the `‚Çπ` symbol, you can switch to a Unicode font (e.g., Noto Sans) and register it with ReportLab.
  - **CSV Export:** A CSV file is also available for download, which includes all line items and final totals.

<br>

## üß∞ Troubleshooting Tips

  - **Buttons require a double-click?** This often happens when `st.rerun()` is used. Check that buttons aren't nested in elements that re-mount on each render and that `st.rerun()` isn't called twice on the same path.
  - **Carousel arrows look wrong?** Ensure that all curly braces `{}` in your CSS f-strings are doubled `{{}}` to prevent formatting errors.
  - **PDF shows squares or junk characters?** This is a font glyph issue. The app uses `Rs` for currency in PDFs to avoid this. If you need the `‚Çπ` symbol, you'll need to register a Unicode TTF font with ReportLab.
